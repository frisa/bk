The Embedded_from_ASM_to_C++
=============================

Preface
=======
As the word of the embedded systems is growing extremely, simuntaleously with the increasing number of applications 
there is also growing the complexity of the embedded systems. The programing languages must fulfill the needs of the programers, 
who are now implementing the functionality much more challanging as in the pass. The assempler as the programing language does need
to be replaced with more sophisticated languages such as C or even C++. This development leads me to make the overview of the programing
principles which are applied to the peripherials in the embedded systems.
